			<a style="font-size:30px">Sometimes I like to stay home alone, especially when I need some relaxation. Then I listen to <br>
	music, watch television or read books. I am fond of reading. I prefer historical novels. Some <br>
	detective stories are very interesting too. It is considered that detective stories can’t be <br>
	regarded as the real literature. I don’t agree with this. Everything depends on the skill and gift<br>
	I don’t go in for sport regularly. But if I have a possibility, I go to the swimming pool.<br> 
	I also like to play different ball games such as volleyball, basketball. <br>
	I am a school leaver now. I have good marks. I am going to enter the university. <br>
	Our teachers say I am good at Literature. It seems to me that in fact I have some attitude for it. My <br>
	think that after graduating from the university it will be difficult to find a job I’ll be trained for.<br>
    But as for me it’s early to discuss this question. The most important thing now is to pass the entrance <br>
	exams well and to enter the university.</a><br></p>
